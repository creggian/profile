profile
=======

The goal of profile is to read and write files that contain run time profiling data. Currently, profile supports:

-   Files created by [`Rprof()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.4.3/topics/Rprof)
-   `.proto` files written by [`pprof -proto`](https://github.com/google/pprof)

The data is available to the user for inspection and manipulation in a documented stable data format.

Installation
------------

You can install profile from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("r-prof/profile")
```

Example
-------

This simple example converts an `.out` file generated by `Rprof()` to the `.proto` format understood by `pprof`.

``` r
library(profile)
ds <- read_rprof("tests/testthat/rprof/1.out")
names(ds)
#> [1] "sample_types" "samples"      "locations"    "functions"   
#> [5] ".rprof"
write_pprof(file.path(tempdir(), "1.pb.gz"), ds)
```
